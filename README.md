# Traffic Light Intersection Project
This project implements a traffic light control system for a two-way intersection (North–West directions) using LabVIEW. It is developed by students from CENT 35 (Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina) as part of the 2025 course “Prácticas Profesionalizantes III”, focusing on programming, system design, and practical applications.
